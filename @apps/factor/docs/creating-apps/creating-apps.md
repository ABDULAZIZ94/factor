# Overview

## Creating Factor Applications

Factor is designed, above all, to enable fast application development. This is done with simple yet powerful extension and customization systems.

To create a fully custom app, you'll just need to learn a few concepts. From there, Factor strives to use standard libraries and tools so your existing development knowledge should help a lot.

> At this point, it is assumed you've successfully added Factor to a project and have the [key services](/docs/services-setup) setup.
