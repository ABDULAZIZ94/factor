# Introduction

![Factor Logo](./img/factor-logo-2.svg)

**Factor** is an open-source web application platform built on the 100% Javasciprt VENM Stack ([VueJs](https://vuejs.org), [Express](https://expressjs.com), [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/), [MongoDB](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo)).

Factor is focused on front-end Javascript developers who want to build dynamic, full-stack applications.

Factor is designed to help developers:

- ship apps as quickly
- implement projects more concisely
- spend less time debugging
- avoid pitfalls

## Core Idea

Factor is extension-focused, and the architecture it's built on was created with this in mind.

Factor includes the following components:

- CLI and Build System
- Express Server and Framework
- VueJS Orchestration (router, store, ssr)
- Standardized dashboard and data-model

While this means Factor has an opinion on these things, it comes with one important benefit:

Plugins and themes know what to expect.

And this allows authors to do more for you. Essentially they can create an experience that "just works" while in other frameworks you could spend days in debugging and config.

## Getting Started

We'll dive into the details of the dashboard, data model, plugins, themes and framework in a bit.
