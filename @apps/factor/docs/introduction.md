## How Factor Is Different

The first question people usually ask is, how is Factor different from everything else out there?

A few key characteristics of Factor:

- **Instant extension** - plugins that "just work," themes that are actually usable.
- **More power with full-stack** - A full stack system means power and simplicity. No more APIs or serverless functions for everything.
- **Simplify with one basic language: Javascript** - Build only with Javascript and Javascript friendly tech (JSON, Mongo, Typescript).
- **Modern tech, modern advantage** - Do things that your friends building PHP apps can only dream of...
- **Remove risk with real open-source** - Built on non-biased open-source tech from developers just like us: Vue, Mongo, Node, Express.

Here is a comparison table to help you quickly see how things compare:
