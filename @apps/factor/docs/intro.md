**Factor** is a full-stack web app platform built on the VENM Stack ([VueJs](https://vuejs.org), [Express](https://expressjs.com), [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/), [MongoDB](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo)).

It's ideal for those who want dynamic functionality&mdash;like email, forms, auth, etc...&mdash; and don't want to use countless APIs to do so.

It's also ideal for people who want to ship apps quickly. Factor's has its primary focus on extension via plugins and themes. Which means you'll spend less time reinventing the wheel and can simply worry about the aspects of your app that relate to your business.

With Factor, the ultimate goal is to help you build professional dynamically driven web apps in the best way possible.

## Who Should Consider Factor
