# Developing a Factor Theme

In a technical sense, Factor themes are just Factor apps that are made editable using settings. Themes have an important role though, they allow you to add a complete UX/UI framework to a Factor app in seconds.

Many people use themes in the following scenarios:

- **Creating a proprietary "secret sauce" when developing for themselves or clients** You might develop a Factor "theme framework" for yourself or clients and then use it over and over again on different sites and apps. This will allow you to do amazing work in very little time.
- **Build and sell themes.** You can build and sell themes with additional functionality to clients. This is also a popular way to make money in the WordPress ecosystem.
- **Share functionality between apps.** You can use a single theme with multiple apps to share functionality across them without having to code things twice.

In this guide, we'll walk through how to set up a theme.
